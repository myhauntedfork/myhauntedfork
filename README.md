Welcome to my profile!

## **Languages**
I know a few languages, including:
- **Python**: The hottest programming language.
- **JavaScript**:  Eternal frustration and occasional pleasure.
- **English (Including Sarcasm & Brainrot)**: I don't *hate* it, I just passionately dislike it.
- **GDScript**:  If I'm going to waste time learning a niche language, I'm gonna do it with style.
- C++: "C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off"
