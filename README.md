Welcome to my profile, The digital equivalent of a "Do Not Disturb" sign.

## **Languages**
Being a polyglot is one of the ways to distract from a profound lack of social skills.\
I know a few languages, including:
- **Python**: Who doesn't like a language named after Monty Python?
- **JavaScript (Including HTML & CSS)**:  The trinity of web development.
- **English (Including Sarcasm & Brainrot)**: I don't *hate* it, I just passionately dislike it.
- **GDScript (Godot)**:  Because if I'm going to waste time learning a niche language, I might as well do it with style.
