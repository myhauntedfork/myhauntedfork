Hello, world! To make bread, you must first invent the universe.

## **Languages**
I know a few languages, including:
- **Python**: The hottest programming language.
- **JavaScript**: Intellectual romantic torture.
- **English (Including Sarcasm & Brainrot)**: I don't *hate* it, I just passionately dislike it.
- **GDScript**: If I'm going to waste time learning a niche language, I'm gonna do it with style.
- **C**: The OG programming language.
- **C++**: "C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off."
- **Swift**: Apple's language for iOS and macOS apps.
